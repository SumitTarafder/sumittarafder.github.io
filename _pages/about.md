Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu). Before that, I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/).


My research interests are mainly in the fields of Bioinformatics and Computational biology. I am enthusiastic about my research and aim to develop my career in the understanding of  molecular elements characteristics in etiology and develop novel methodology as a computational tool to deal with the vast data in genomics and proteomics.
